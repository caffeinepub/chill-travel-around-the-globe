# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a non-functional “Map” button with a simple 2D icon next to the existing “Flying” button in the Travelogue journey action buttons area.

**Planned changes:**
- Insert a new “Map” action button directly next to the existing “Flying” button within each Travelogue journey card’s action button area.
- Display a simple “2D” logo/icon on the “Map” button alongside the “Map” label.
- Ensure the “Map” button has no click behavior (no navigation, state changes, toasts, map updates, or backend calls).

**User-visible outcome:** Users see a new “Map” button (with a visible 2D icon) next to “Flying” in Travelogue journey cards, and clicking it does nothing.
