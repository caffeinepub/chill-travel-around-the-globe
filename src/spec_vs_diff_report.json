Only an additional icon import (\"Map\") is visible in the truncated TraveloguePanel.tsx snippet, and the other modified files are project metadata/summaries.",

      "requirement": "Add a new button labeled \"Map\" positioned directly next to the existing \"Flying\" button in the Travelogue journey action buttons area, and display a simple \"2D\" logo/icon on the button.",
      "reason": "In the provided truncated diff for TraveloguePanel.tsx, there is no visible JSX/markup showing a new \"Map\" button, no evidence of positioning next to the existing \"Flying\" button, and no evidence of a \"2D\" logo/icon being rendered on that button (only an import of a Map icon is shown).",

      "requirement": "Do not implement any functionality for the new \"Map\" button yet (no navigation, no state changes, no toasts, no map updates, and no backend calls when clicked).",
      "reason": "Because the diff does not show the Map button being added, it also does not show the click handler (or lack thereof). Additionally, toast is imported in the component, but the truncated view does not allow verifying whether the Map button triggers side effects or none.",
