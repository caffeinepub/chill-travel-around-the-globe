  "summary": "The diff appears to implement the Travelogue “Map” button, wires a new TraveloguePanel callback into LocationMapExplorer, and updates MapComponent to accept and render journey schedule items on the existing 2D map. However, due to truncation, some acceptance-criteria details (exact button placement/label and the user-visible error behavior when some locations cannot be mapped) are not fully verifiable from the provided excerpts.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Add a new button labeled exactly \"Map\" with a 2D/map-style icon, positioned next to the existing \"Flying\" button in the Travelogue journey action row.",
      "reason": "TraveloguePanel shows the new Map icon import and an onMapJourney prop, but the diff excerpt is truncated before showing the actual action-row JSX, so exact label text (\"Map\") and placement next to the existing \"Flying\" button cannot be confirmed from the provided evidence.",

      "requirement": "If one or more schedule items cannot be mapped to coordinates, the app does not crash and shows a user-visible error/toast indicating some locations could not be displayed.",
      "reason": "The LocationMapExplorer excerpt is truncated before showing the handleMapJourney implementation and any partial-failure handling. The file summary mentions toast usage, but the exact behavior for partial mapping failures cannot be verified from code excerpts.",
