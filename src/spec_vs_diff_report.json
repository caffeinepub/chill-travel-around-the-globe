  "summary": "Diff shows partial work toward itinerary date-range formatting in TraveloguePanel, but does not provide sufficient evidence that the required formatting is fully applied to the specified header paragraph nor that schedule wrapping and arrow shortening were implemented. Two non-requested files were modified.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Update the journey period text in the selected header paragraph to format \"DD Mon YY (Ddd) ~ DD Mon YY (Ddd)\" with a \" ~ \" separator.",
      "reason": "TraveloguePanel.tsx adds a new formatDateRange helper using Intl.DateTimeFormat with 2-digit day/year and short month/weekday, but the diff is truncated before showing the final string composition (including parentheses and the exact \" ~ \" separator) and does not show that this formatted value is actually rendered in the specific header paragraph element.",

      "requirement": "Reduce the selected connector arrow SVG length by ~50% while preserving dotted curved style and arrowhead.",
      "reason": "No SVG/path/width/viewport changes for the connector arrow are shown in the diff summary; only date formatting logic is visible in the truncated excerpt.",
