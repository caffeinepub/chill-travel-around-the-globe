  "summary": "The diff does not show updates to the specified Day label span elements in ScrapbookItineraryView (Doodle) or RetroPostcardItineraryView (Retro). Instead, it modifies TraveloguePanel.tsx with date formatting utilities and updates metadata/summary files, which does not demonstrably implement the required three-line Day/date/weekday rendering in the two targeted elements.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "Update ONLY the two selected Day label elements in the Doodle (ScrapbookItineraryView) and Retro (RetroPostcardItineraryView) itinerary views so that each Day label renders three lines: (1) “Day N”, (2) date formatted like “11 Feb”, (3) weekday formatted like “Wed”, derived from the actual day being rendered; no other UI/layout changes.",
      "reason": "No changes are shown to ScrapbookItineraryView or RetroPostcardItineraryView, nor to any Day label span rendering. The only code change shown is in TraveloguePanel.tsx, which contains generic date formatting functions but no evidence of updating the two specified Day label elements.",

    {
      "description": "Added/modified date formatting and date-range formatting logic in TraveloguePanel.tsx (e.g., formatDateRange with weekday/year formatting) unrelated to updating the two specified itinerary Day label span elements.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest constrains changes to ONLY the two selected Day label elements in Doodle and Retro itinerary views; modifying TraveloguePanel.tsx suggests broader/unrequested work and does not map to the specified XPaths/views.",

    {
      "description": "Updated project tracking/metadata (project_state.json) and a broad frontend summary file (frontend-file-summaries.txt) without evidence of implementing the requested UI change in the targeted components.",
