  "summary": "Diff shows groundwork for a third itinerary theme (type includes 'plain' and CSS mentions Plain theme styles), but the provided truncated changes do not clearly demonstrate the required UI control updates (star removal, text wrapping) nor confirm the 'Plain' option is exposed and applied only to the specified itinerary elements.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Remove the star logo/icon from the selected Element 1 theme button without changing click behavior.",
      "reason": "The diff snippet does not include the JSX/markup for the specific Element 1 button, so there is no direct evidence the star icon was removed from that button (and that no spacing remains) while preserving its click behavior.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/TraveloguePanel.tsx (truncated)"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Ensure the selected Element 2 button’s text wraps onto multiple lines when long, with no truncation/ellipsis.",
      "reason": "No button styling/props for the specific Element 2 button are shown in the truncated TraveloguePanel diff, and no CSS evidence is shown that targets that exact button to enable wrapping and remove truncation/ellipsis.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Add a third theme option labeled \"Plain\" alongside Doodle and Retro within the existing theme controls, and when selected apply minimal/neutral styling only to the specified itinerary elements (Elements 3–5), with correct switching among all three themes.",
      "reason": "While the code introduces an ItineraryTheme union including 'plain' and mentions Plain theme CSS, the truncated diff does not show (a) the actual theme control UI containing a visible \"Plain\" label, nor (b) evidence that switching applies styles exclusively to the specified itinerary elements and not to other elements outside the given XPaths.",
